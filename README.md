Arduino project for self balancing robot

We have two Arduino files, one for master and one for the slave

Maybe some libraries will be needed to be writen for easier code

We will use 2 DC motors and one gyro MPU-6050

The master is a Arduino Opta and the slave is an Arduino Uno with a Ethernet Shield.
